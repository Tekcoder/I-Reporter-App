# I-Reporter-App
This app enables any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the general public

It allows individuals to create accounts. After successful creation of the account, it gives the users access to create a red-flag record; an incident linked to corruption and an intervention record; a call for a government agency to intervene e.g
repair bad road sections, collapsed bridges, flooding e.t.c.

Furthermore, users can either edit or delete their red-flag or intervention records. They can also add oe change geolocation (Lat Long Coordinates) to their red-flag or intervention
records .

The Admins on the otherhand can change the status of a record to either under investigation, rejected (in the event of a false claim) or resolved (in the event that the claim has been investigated and resolved).

Other additional features:

- Users can add images to their red-flag or intervention records, to support their claims.
- Users can add videos to their red-flag or intervention records, to support their claims.
- The application should display a Google Map with Marker showing the red-flag or intervention location.
- The user gets real-time email notification when Admin changes the status of their record.
